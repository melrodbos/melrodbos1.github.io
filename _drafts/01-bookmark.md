The Kuler web interface from Adobe is an interactive color panel that allows you to create custom color themes. It is very simple to use and it comes in handy when hex color values are needed. There is a Kuler extension for Photoshop as well as a mobile app. Now that we are starting to build our own projects and making design decisions, this bookmark is a great reference to go to.
