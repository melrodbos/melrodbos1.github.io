Reflective Journal Week 5, Final Draft

I have officially drowned in a waterless pool. Week five was something to remember. We started our week with an introduction to the Github API. What was intended to be our review week became more of a stress builder than anything else. Futile attempts to complete old assignments in order to move forward with new material while working on a new project is not ideal. But lets leave Utopia to Tomás Moro and concentrate on what really matters.

Working on our github.io blog was real fun. Trying to replicate a static website template by building our own CSS and HTML was a good exercise but I wish I could practice more before moving on. Rebuilding the Code Drops templates was an exciting prospect up until I couldn’t... I can not think of an appropriate or an inappropriate way to describe how much never being able to complete a given task feels like. Regardless of how I feel at this moment of reflection, I know that I am learning valuable information that I could not have experienced in any other context.
