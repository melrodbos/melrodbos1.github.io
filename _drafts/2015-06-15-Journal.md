Journal Week 6

Week six was intense. We were introduced to the Octocat API and how to fetch data from it. Curl and Postman were the tools helping us request the data. My tool of preference is curl which is managed through the comand line. Reading the API documentation was interesting, almost impossible to decipher sometimes but with the right tutorials, following the examples and also playing a little bit of a guessing game, all the endpoints (URIs) were found . 

We were instructed to work in pairs for our weekend assignment which was API related as well. I wish I could have managed my time in a more optimal way in order to finish. I learned a valuable lesson about scoping and time management last weekend.
