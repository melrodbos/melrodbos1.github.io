####Reflective Journal Entry

Third Week is the Charm...

On our third week, we were introduced to CSS (which stands for Cascading Style Sheet) and JQuery. I must say I felt I little relieved and maybe a little excited only because the CSS terminology is more familiar (I took a Code Academy training course about two years ago) whereas JavaScript still felt like a stranger (Never finished Code School). It wasn't until the Fullwidth tabs exercise, where our controller was JQuery that all the JavaScript "non-sense" I had in my mind started to click. I am not saying that I had an AHA! moment, but I am certainly kind of understanding what I see now.
