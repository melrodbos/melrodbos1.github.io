####Reflective Journal Entry - Rough Draft

Third Week is the Charm?

On our third week, we were introduced to CSS (which stands for Cascading Style Sheet) and JQuery. I must say I felt I little relieved and maybe a little excited only because the CSS terminology was more familiar(?) whereas JavaScript still felt like a stranger (I didn't finish Code School). It wasn't until the Full Width Tabs exercise, where our controller was JQuery, that all the JavaScript "non-sense" I had in my mind started to click. I am not saying that I had an AHA! moment, but I think I have a better understanding of what I see now.

I really feel that that if I practice coding more often, at least 60% of my doubting code thoughts will be gone. But I am struggling, by the time I am done with “living”(and I am not including sleep time; that would be 2 hours, 3 hours of sleep maximum a day), yak shaving, solving merge conflicts and planning, I have no time left to practice. The majority of the time I feel that I blindly read through the documents and articles given in class and that really hurts me, because I enjoy reading and learning. Right now I feel that I am drowning rapidly and what is worst is that there is no water involved. The feeling of "constant incompleteness” is a relentless bastard that’s been stepping on my shoulders since week one. And my “Pomodoro 30 minutes” are gone...
