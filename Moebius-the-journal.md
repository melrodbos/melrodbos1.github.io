### Week One

#### Things I've learned:

- Moving around github (things that I understand (now))
 - creating, issues, forking a repo, cloning a repo and creating pull requests
 - The command line (git):
   - Wow... Never thought I would use it or even understand it, but now I really appreciate managing almost everything in one place.
   - Need to try to create a pull request from Terminal. 
   - Working on a git cheat sheet.

#### Week One

So I thought leaving my kids at home after three and half years of literally spending every second with them was going to be the difficult partâ€¦ Not. The first week at the Iron Yard has been challenging to the bone. I have fallen asleep with my eyes open, read books and articles considerably above my level of understanding (I am humbled, like, really humbled) and now I have come to believe that the world is conspiring against any possible speck of new information wanting to crawl into my brain. 

The program itself has proven to be one of the hardest roads I have ever taken ( reminder: it has only been 10 days). Github, repository, fork, pull request, git, command line, atom, JavaScript, HTML, CSS have looped into my brain wiring with a running debugger and no pause button. ok..ok
