##### Final Draft (Second Revision)

After two weeks of religiously devoting myself to unknown disciplines (Git, Github, JavaScript) I am attached to the idea that joining this program is, and will be, a wonderfully painful diversion (that is, if we consider toddler rune cryptography a career, of course). Many challenges arise proving the web developer world an ever changing coding spectrum. I find this world a fascinating one and I am exited that I am becoming a part of it but I sometimes question if I will be a good fit. I love learning, any type of new data is welcome to feed my brain and I am grateful to be surrounded by brilliant minds that help nourish mine. It might be unintentional lack of confidence on my part but I am working on building a solid structure to facilitate the massive intake of new information that we are experiencing in order to put that into practice. 

On our second week at the Front End Engineering program, we were introduced to the Model View Controller (MVC) pattern, which involves the use of three folders: 
  - **Model**: This folder would include a javaScript file with our declared functions
  - **View**: This one includes our HTML file
  - **Controller**: This folder includes a javaScript file with the actions and events that will communicate with our model and our view folders.

I think I understand the MVC structure but I am still struggling with my very limited javaScript knowledge. I have established a plan to tackle as much Javascript practice this weekend as possible. I will start by completing the JavaScript training courses from the Code Academy and I will also review Code School's JavaScript course. Meanwhile, I'll be practicing coding the Todo List from our past assignments. 

I just started implementing the [Pomodoro Learning Technique](http://pomodorotechnique.com/) this morning and so far it has helped me accomplish a great portion of the homework, that because of poor time management I was not able to complete. So, yessss, I feel pretty good about that and I am confident it will help me go through enough JavaScript practice to understand what I am doing (maybe?). And residually increase my chance of a better performance with jQuery on our third week.
