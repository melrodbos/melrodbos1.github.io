<h3 id="week-two">Week Two</h3>

<p>Note: This is a very, very rough draft…</p>

<h4 id="things-ive-learned">Things I’ve learned:</h4>

<ul>
  <li><strong>MCV</strong> (Model- View- Controller pattern)</li>
  <li>Model: This is where my functions go. Example from class: todo.js</li>
  <li>View: The html file.</li>
  <li>
    <p>Controller: My app.js</p>
  </li>
  <li>Two whole weeks at The Iron Yard. That was a religious experience. Sometimes you just need to channel the higher spirits in order to receive a little Divine help. Needless to say, I have struggled greatly with applying all the information we have learned into coding. Picking my battles and prioritizing have become daily routine.</li>
</ul>

<p>To further elaborate:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Vanilla JS is a fascinating language but requires almost exclusivity. When applied to the MVC pattern it becomes a force of its own. Identifying the right eventListeners, the concept of parent- child elements, functions within functions, arrays within arrays within functions… It is challenging to follow and I pretty much get lost most of the time.</li>
  <li>Reviewing the training courses  from Code Academy and Code School has helped and I have seen improvement productivity wise and I have also noticed my homework quality has increased. I will make a habit of weekly reviews every weekend.</li>
</ul>

<p>another entry…</p>

<p>After two weeks of religiously devoting myself to an unknown discipline different from deciphering toddler runes and passive agressivly reading children’s books, I am attached to the idea that joining this program is, and will be, a wonderfully painful diversion. Many challenges arise proving the web developer world an ever changing coding spectrum. As I mentioned in my outlined entries for this week, Vanilla JS has been an immense struggle for myself. And applying it to an MVC pattern has made my brain burn. I admit that I might have compared understanding Vanilla JS as close as auto-flagellation as it can be. Having described those premature feelings about JavaScript, I must say that my feelings have evolved and now I look forward to every challenge.</p>
