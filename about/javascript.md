# Reading JavaScript

## Basic literal types 
 - `null.`: Special keyword denoting a null or empty value. It literally means no value. Intentionally empty.
 - `Boolean.`: `true` or `false`. It has exactly two values: true or false. Additional note: We can feed Boolean       numbers. If the numbers are greater than zero, the returned value will be ```True```. If the fed numbers are equal or less than zero, the returned value will be ```False```. (`Boolean` is a *Primitive* value) 
 - `Number.`: A numeric value. 
 - `String.`: Text. A sequence of characters that are written with quotes. We can use double quotes or single quotes. (Javascript does not care for double or sigle quotes)

## Special Constants
 - `Infinity`: Numeric value representing infinity. It has infinite values.
 - `NaN`: Not-a-Number. [A value that can not be represented.] (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/search?q=Nan+meaning)
 - `undefined`: Is a top level property whose value is [undefined] (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Grammar_and_types#Basics).
