## Reading CSS

- What is CSS? 
  - CSS stands for *Cascading Style Sheets
  - Css styles the content of the page that HTML displays. In other words, with CSS we create rules to specify how content should be seen on a web page. 
  - A CSS rule consists of two parts: 
    1. **selector** 
      - Examples of selectors are *headers* (`h1`, `h2`, `h3`...), *paragraph* (`p`) and *body* (`body`).
      - Selectors *MATCH* HTML elements! 
      - They can contain one or more selectors (type, class or ID)
      - They are separated by *combinators*. Combinators explain the relationship between the selectors. Some examples include the use of *whitespace*, `>`, `+` and tilde `~`.

    2. **declaration**
  - The declaration will always sit inside the curly braces `{ }`.
  - It consists of a property name followed by a colon, which is then followed by a value. 
  - The following image from [Team Treehouse blog](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/getting-started-with-css-part-1) shows a CSS rule:

 2. `background-color:`
