## Reading CSS

- What is CSS? 
  - CSS stands for *Cascading Style Sheets
  - Css styles the content of the page that HTML displays. In other words, with CSS we create rules to specify how content should be seen on a web page. 
  - A CSS rule consists of two parts: 
    1. **selector** 
      Examples of selectors are *headers* (`h1`, `h2`, `h3`...), *paragraph* (`p`) and *body* (`body`)
    2. **declaration**
  - The following image from [Team Treehouse blog](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/getting-started-with-css-part-1) shows a CSS rule:
