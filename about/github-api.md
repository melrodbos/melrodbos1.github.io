### Reading APIs (Application Programming Interface)

- An API is a set of routines, protocols and tools for building software appliactions. 

**How does the API handle authentication?**
  - There are three ways to authenticate through Github API.
  - Requests that require authentication will return: `404 Not Found`, instead of `403 Forbidden`, in some places. *This is to prevent the accidental leakege of private repos to unauthorized users.* 
**Do I need to authenticate?**
  - 
**What can I do with an unauthenticated request?**

**How can I authenticate my request? (3 ways)**
 

#### How do I ask the API for...:

- [ ] **The profile information for a specific user?**
- [ ] **The repository listing for a specific user?**
- [ ] **The recent, public activity for a specific user?**
- [ ] **Is there a limit to the number of requests I can make?**
- [ ] **Is there a way of extending that limit?**
- [ ] **What happens when I hit the limit?**
- [ ] **What if there is a lot of data returned?**
- [ ] **How can I ask for more (or less) data from a request?**
- [ ] **How do I know that there is more data available?**
