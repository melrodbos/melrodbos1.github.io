- What is HTML? 
  - HTML stands for **HyperText Markup Language**
  - HTML is used for creating and visually representing a webpage. It describes the structure of the page.
- HTML Structure: 
    1. **selector** 
      - Examples of selectors are *headers* (`h1`, `h2`, `h3`...), *paragraph* (`p`) and *body* (`body`).
      - Selectors *MATCH* HTML elements! 
      - They can contain one or more selectors (type, class or ID)
      - They are separated by *combinators*. Combinators explain the relationship between the selectors. Some examples include the use of *whitespace*, `>`, `+` and tilde `~`.

    2. **declaration**
  - The declaration will always sit inside the curly braces `{ }`.
  - It consists of a property name followed by a colon, which is then followed by a value.
