### Week Two

Note: This is a very, very rough draft...

#### Things I've learned:

- **MCV** (Model- View- Controller pattern)
 - Model: This is where my functions go. Example from class: todo.js
 - View: The html file. 
 - Controller: My app.js

- Two whole weeks at The Iron Yard. That was a religious experience. Sometimes you just need to channel the higher spirits in order to receive a little Divine help. Needless to say, I have struggled greatly with applying all the information we have learned into coding. Picking my battles and prioritizing have become daily routine. 
 
To further elaborate:

- Vanilla JS is a fascinating language but requires almost exclusivity. When applied to the MVC pattern it becomes a force of its own. Identifying the right eventListeners, the concept of parent- child elements, functions within functions, arrays within arrays within functionsâ€¦ It is challenging to follow and I pretty much get lost most of the time. 
- Reviewing the training courses  from Code Academy and Code School has helped and I have seen improvement productivity wise and I have also noticed my homework quality has increased. I will make a habit of weekly reviews every weekend.
