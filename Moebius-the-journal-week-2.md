### Week Two

Note: This is a very, very rough draft...

#### Things I've learned:

- **MCV** (Model- View- Controller pattern)
 - Model: This is where my functions go. Example from class: todo.js
 - View: The html file. 
 - Controller: My app.js

- Two whole weeks at The Iron Yard. That was a religious experience. Sometimes you just need to channel the higher spirits in order to receive a little Divine help. Needless to say, I have struggled greatly with applying all the information we have learned into coding. Picking my battles and prioritizing have become daily routine. 
 
To further elaborate:

- Vanilla JS is a fascinating language but requires almost exclusivity. When applied to the MVC pattern it becomes a force of its own. Identifying the right eventListeners, the concept of parent- child elements, functions within functions, arrays within arrays within functions… It is challenging to follow and I pretty much get lost most of the time. 
- Reviewing the training courses  from Code Academy and Code School has helped and I have seen improvement productivity wise and I have also noticed my homework quality has increased. I will make a habit of weekly reviews every weekend.

After two weeks of religiously devoting myself to an unknown discipline different from deciphering toddler runes and passive agressivly reading children’s books, I am attached to the idea that joining this program is, and will be, a wonderfully painful diversion. Many challenges arise proving the web developer world an ever changing coding spectrum. As I mentioned in my outlined entries for this week, Vanilla JS has been an immense struggle for myself. And applying it to an MVC pattern has made my brain burn. I admit that I might have compared understanding Vanilla JS as close as auto-flagellation as it can be. Having described those premature feelings about JavaScript, I must say that my feelings have evolved and now I look forward to every challenge.
