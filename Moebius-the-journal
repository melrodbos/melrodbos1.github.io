### Week One

#### Things I've learned:

- Moving around github (things that I understand (now))
 - creating, issues, forking a repo, cloning a repo and creating pull requests
 - The command line (git):
   - Wow... Never thought I would use it or even understand it, but now I really appreciate managing almost everything in one place.
   - Need to try to create a pull request from Terminal. 
   - Working on a git cheat sheet.
