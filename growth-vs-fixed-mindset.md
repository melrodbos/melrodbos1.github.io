## 2. Rough Draft... and I mean really rough... 

- The importance of having the right mindset when exposed to information, especially new information.

## 3. Final Draft towards final read...

What is a fixed mindset? What is a growth mindset? Am I stuck in one mindset? Or is my brain switching from a fixed mindset to a growth mindset periodically? According to Dr. Carol Dwek, a fixed mindset is commonly asossiated to nature, with the *wildly* popular believe (my self partly included for a period of time) that people that perform smartly given new challenges are just naturally born smart to begin with. Now, on the other hand, the concept of a growth mindset expands on the *proven fact* (Dr. Carol Dwek extensive research with students) that people are born with the same learning capabilities and it is by the power of suggestion, positive reinforcement and a nurturing positive attitude towards the unknown, that people thrive. In Dr. Carol Dwek own words ([see video reference here](https://youtu.be/wh0OS4MrN3E)), "a growth mindset is when students believe their abilities can be developed".

Lets think for a moment and sit on the idea that that we are actually born smart. With all the eye/ mind opening information that I have been listening from Dr. Dwek, just the thought of believing in the concept of traceable intelligence through the genetic pool seems dooming. I am doomed! Coursed! Subjected to a life of fear, insecurity and seclusion, all with infectious possibilities (I have two kids). With a fixed mindset we only focus on results, on meeting everyone else’s expectations. We end up having no regard for our own self or others. It is with great sadness that I admit I am guilty of suffering of massive peer pressure for more time that I can remember. Lets not think that we have only so much to give, that we can only go so far, lets not limit ourselves from growing. Lets in turn evaluate the growth mindset.

Based on Dr. Dwek's definition of *Growth Mindset*: “A growth mindset is when students believe that their abilities can be developed”. Awakening! That is all I have to say. It is a little difficult not to acknowlege a feeling of resentment to myself to be honest. The fear of not fitting into the "standard" container. When a nurturing and positive learning environment is enforced, there is minimal to none room for failure because everybody is open to learn. They see change in a positive way. Challenge is viewed as an opportunity as opposed to a test to evaluate what is supposed to be known, solely focused on the outcome. 

Now lets discuss an interesting approach to learning psicology with Dr. Dwek's on point *Power of Yet* study. When giving a group of 10 year olds a *difficult* or advanced task. Some of the kids reacted in a surprisingly positive way, with some of them expressing their interest in new challenges and learning opportunities. Whereas the other group of kids that had been given the same task reacted by expressing their unconfortability with the unknown. Sounds familiar? For me, it does. Many times I chewed my lails to the flesh just thinking about what the outcome of a chemistry class test would be. At the time I was not focused on the learning experience that the test or challenge represented, I was focused on the shame of failing. I still struggle with letting those outcome focused attachments go. The difference between myself fifteen year ago and myself now, is that I acknowledge that I have a choice *not* to worry about the outcome. I now choose a *not yet* over a passing or failing grade anyday.
